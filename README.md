# MD4SG-ALP-Spring24
This is the repository for the [**Algorithms, Law, and Policy Working Group**](https://www.md4sg.com/workinggroups/lawpolicy) (Spring 2024), a [Mechanism Design for Social Good (MD4SG)](https://www.md4sg.com/index.html) working group.

# Program:

## Topics of interest:
Our focus this term is on exploring global perspectives on AI policy and regulation. In each session, we will dive into a range of different AI policy issues. Some topics we're looking at include (such as Japan's stance to not enforce copyright on AI training data, the EU's AI Act on foundation model-specific rules, and the US’s compute threshold approach to foundation model regulation, set out in Biden’s executive order).

We are currently putting together a schedule to plan biweekly meetings between January and May 2024.
Sessions will be a mix of **invited speakers**, **presentations by group members**, and **guided readings and discussions**.

## Tentative Schedule:
